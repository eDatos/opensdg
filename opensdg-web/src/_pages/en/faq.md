## What does the reporting status mean?
We have used three different types of reporting status for an indicator, which are also colour coded:

* Reported online (black) – as a minimum the headline national data for this indicator is available on this website but the data might not be fully disaggregated yet. We are continuing to source additional disaggregations.
* Statistics in progress (grey) – we have found a suitable source of data for this indicator or relevant proxy at national level. We are currently quality assuring the data and preparing it for publication.
* Exploring data sources (white) – we are still looking for a suitable data source for this indicator.

Where there is additional information about the status of indicator data collection and reporting, this will be displayed at the top of the indicator page.

<!-- ## Can other countries copy this website?
Yes. This site is built and hosted using 100% free software and services, so other countries and localities can freely and easily reuse our code. Technical guidance on implementing this platform is available [here](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io). Countries and localities exploring how to report their own SDGs data can also get support from the [Center for Open Data Enterprise (CODE)](http://www.opendataenterprise.org/) through their [SDG National Reporting Initiative](https://www.sdgreporting.org/). -->
